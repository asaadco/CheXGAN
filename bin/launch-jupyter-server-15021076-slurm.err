To connect to the compute node gpu510-32 on Ibex running your Jupyter server, 
you need to create an ssh tunnel from your local machine to login node on Ibex 
using the following command.

ssh -L 12890:gpu510-32:12890 alghas0c@glogin.ibex.kaust.edu.sa 

Next, you need to copy the second url provided below and paste it into the browser 
on your local machine.

/home/alghas0c/projects/GAN/env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jupyter_server/transutils.py:13: FutureWarning: The alias `_()` will be deprecated. Use `_i18n()` instead.
